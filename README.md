# echo-probe
Trying to rebuild the ultrasound device as described in the "echomods" repository by kelu124. Ultimate goal is to develop a medical ultrasound consisting of the forementioned modules and a lightweight probe. Since the device will be used in medical research it does not have to be portable. However, the image resolution should be somewhat acceptable. The probe itself should not weigh more than 200g in order to be mounted to a rack in the lab. Moreover, the probe should not only work submerged in water, it should work when put onto tissue just like a commercially available ultrasound device.
